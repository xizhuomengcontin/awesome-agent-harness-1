# Awesome Agent Harness [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools, frameworks, and resources for **agent harness engineering** — the discipline of designing environments, constraints, and feedback loops that make AI coding agents reliable at scale.

## What is an Agent Harness?

An agent harness is the infrastructure that wraps around an LLM coding agent. It's everything except the model itself: session management, context delivery, tool design, architectural enforcement, failure recovery, and human oversight.

OpenAI's [Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) blog defined the term: *"When a software engineering team's primary job is no longer to write code, but to design environments, specify intent, and build feedback loops that allow agents to do reliable work."* Their team built 1M+ lines of production code with zero human-written lines using this approach.

Anthropic's Claude Code team [discovered the same principles](https://x.com/trq212/status/2027463795355095314) from the tool design side: the harness matters more than the model. Fewer, more expressive tools beat a long menu of narrow ones. Progressive disclosure — letting the agent recursively discover context across layers — outperforms loading everything upfront. *"Designing an agent's action space is as much an art as it is a science."*

## Core Principles

From the two seminal references above:

1. **Humans steer, agents execute** — Engineers design environments and review outcomes, not write code
2. **Repository knowledge is the system of record** — If it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist to the agent. Slack threads, Google Docs, and tribal knowledge are invisible
3. **AGENTS.md is a table of contents, not an encyclopedia** — Point to deeper sources of truth; don't dump everything in one file
4. **Enforce architecture mechanically** — Custom linters, structural tests, and CI checks replace code review for invariants
5. **Agent legibility is the goal** — Optimize code for agent readability first, human readability second
6. **Fewer tools, more expressiveness** — Progressive disclosure and composable primitives beat sprawling toolkits
7. **See like an agent** — Read the model's outputs, watch where it struggles, and evolve the harness accordingly
8. **Corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive** — At high agent throughput, fix-forward beats blocking merge gates

## Full Lifecycle Platforms

Tools that span from requirements to delivery with human-in-the-loop approval.

- [Chorus](https://github.com/Chorus-AIDLC/Chorus) — Agent harness for requirements-to-delivery. Task DAGs, sub-agent orchestration (Agent Teams), proof of work, human approval gates. AI proposes, humans verify.

Pushes the "agents execute" principle to its extreme — designed for fully autonomous operation with no human in the loop.
- [Multica](https://github.com/multica-ai/multica) — Open-source managed agents platform. "Turn coding agents into real teammates" — assign tasks, track progress, compound skills across sessions. Validates the core premise that agents need team-level management, not just individual harnesses.

## Agent Orchestrators

Orchestrators solve the throughput problem: at high agent velocity, you need parallel execution with worktree isolation so agents don't step on each other. As OpenAI found, "corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive" — these tools maximize concurrent agent throughput.

- [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) — Kanban-based orchestrator with git worktree isolation per agent. Supports 10+ coding agents. Enforces the "one agent, one worktree" pattern that keeps parallel execution clean.

- [Scion](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scion) — Google's open-source multi-agent orchestration testbed. Manages "deep agents" (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex) as isolated, concurrent processes — each gets its own container, git worktree, and credentials. Agent memory, chatrooms, and task management as orthogonal, pluggable modules.
- [Gas Town](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown) — Steve Yegge's multi-agent workspace manager. Docker-based with a "Mayor" orchestrator that distributes work as "beads" across agent "convoys." Includes web dashboard, git worktree isolation, and hook-based work state management.

## Task Runners

Task runners bridge the gap between issue trackers and coding agents. They embody the "humans steer, agents execute" principle: a human (or PM agent) creates the issue, the runner spawns an agent, and the output is a PR ready for review.

## Agent Runtimes

The persistent infrastructure layer. Agent runtimes give coding agents long-running capabilities they lack natively: persistent memory, cron scheduling, multi-channel messaging, and sub-agent spawning. If orchestrators solve throughput and task runners solve issue-to-PR, runtimes solve "how does an agent stay alive and connected between tasks."

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — AI agent runtime. Orchestrates agents across messaging channels with skill system, sub-agent spawning, and persistent session management.
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — Library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Functions as an agent runtime managing execution, state, and coordination of agentic workflows. Built on LangChain.
- [Nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) — Lightweight alternative to OpenClaw that runs in containers. Connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, and other channels with a security-first, container-based isolation model.
- [Claude Managed Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/managed-agents) — Anthropic's managed agent infrastructure. Pre-built, configurable agent harness running on managed infra — you define agent templates (tools, skills, repos), Anthropic provides the harness and execution environment. Decouples "brain" (Claude + harness) from "hands" (sandboxes + tools) and "session" (event log). Designed for long-horizon tasks as Claude's task horizon grows exponentially.

## Agent Knowledge & Memory

Agents that run across sessions need persistent memory and shared knowledge. These tools solve the "context cliff" problem — without them, every new session starts from zero.

- [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) — Automatic session capture with AI compression and injection into future sessions. Solves the stateless-agent problem by giving Claude Code persistent memory across runs.
- [cq](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/cq) — Mozilla developer project enabling AI coding agents to share learned knowledge. A commons where agents deposit and retrieve solutions, avoiding redundant problem-solving. Has Claude Code and OpenCode plugins.
- [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho) — Agent state memory library. Provides the persistence layer for stateful agents — session history, user context, and learned preferences.
- [Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) — Agent memory that learns. Automatically captures, indexes, and retrieves agent execution history to improve future task performance.
- [CodeBurn](https://github.com/AgentSeal/codeburn) — Claude Code token usage analytics. Breaks down token consumption by task, enabling cost attribution and optimization.

## Run Capture & Replay

Principle 7 — *see like an agent* — needs something that kept the run. These tools capture what a
session actually did, so a failure can be inspected after the fact rather than reconstructed from
memory, and in some cases re-executed without paying for the model again.

- [OrcaReplay](https://github.com/Continuum-AI-Corp/OrcaReplay) — Records a coding-agent session from outside the process and replays it offline: the same run again, served from the trace, with no model called and no key needed. Adapters for Claude Code, Codex, goose, opencode, Cursor and others; the verdict is a number (`reused=6/6 exact=6 divergences=0`), not a log to read.

## Coding Agents

The execution layer. In harness engineering, the agent is a commodity — the harness is the differentiator. These agents write code; everything above them determines whether that code is useful.

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/) — Anthropic's coding agent. The team's own harness pioneered "seeing like an agent" — progressive disclosure via skill files, fewer composable tools over many narrow ones. Agent Teams enables multi-agent coordination. The Claude Agent SDK extends the harness beyond coding.

## Requirements & Spec Tools

The planning layer addresses the biggest harness gap: agents can write code, but someone has to decide what to build. "Repository knowledge is the system of record" — these tools generate the specs and requirements that agents consume.

- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/) — AWS's spec-driven development IDE. Generates structured specs and manages requirements.
- [OpenSpec](https://github.com/FissionAI/openspec) — Spec-driven development CLI. Generate structured specs from natural language.
